# Backwards Guessing Game

## Overview
The Backwards Guessing Game is a simple web-based game where the roles are reversed in the classic guessing game format. Instead of the user guessing a number that the computer has in mind, the computer tries to guess a number that the user thinks of. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
- The user thinks of a number between 1 and 100, and the computer makes guesses based on user feedback.
- The user provides feedback if the computer's guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- The computer has a maximum of five attempts to guess the correct number.
- Responsive design for a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.

## How to Play
1. Open the website and click on the 'Start Game' button.
2. Think of a number between 1 and 100, and keep it in mind.
3. The computer will make a guess, and you provide feedback by clicking on 'Too Low', 'Too High', or 'Correct'.
4. If the computer guesses your number within five attempts, it wins. Otherwise, you win.
5. Click on 'Restart Game' to play again.
